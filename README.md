======================================================================
Project by: Costanzo Di Maria.


=====================================================================
Project overview.
This project utilises the Huam Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset version 1.0.
The original data is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
A comprehensive description of the raw data is available in the README.txt filecontained in the zip folder above.


Starting from the raw data set above, the project instructions required to:

Question 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Question 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Question 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Question 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

Question 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The characteristics of a tidy data set are:

1) Each variable forms a column.
2) Each observation forms a row.
3) Each type of observational unit forms a table.
